```bash
sudo su
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/nvme0n1p2 luks_root
vgchange -ay
lvscan
mkdir /media/linux
mount /dev/vgubuntu/root /media/linux/
mount -o bind /proc /media/linux/proc
mount -o bind /dev /media/linux/dev
mount -o bind /sys /media/linux/sys
chroot /media/linux /bin/bash
```

List drives
```bash
fdisk -l
```

Mount EFI
```bash
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot/efi
```

NOTE: If you want to install LUKS encryption for GRUB CLI jump [here](#enable-luks-support-for-grub)

Install GRUB on drive
```bash
grub-install /dev/nvme0n1
grub-update
```

Unmount
```bash
umount /boot/efi
exit
```

Unmount drive
```bash
umount /media/linux/boot/efi
umount -l /media/linux
```

Re-encrypt LUKS drive
```bash
vgchange-an
cryptsetup luksClose luks_root
```

# Enable LUKS Support for GRUB

```bash
sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=esp --bootloader-id=GRUB --modules="tpm" --disable-shim-lock
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
**Key Options for grub-install**

Here are some common flags you can use with grub-install:

--modules="module1 module2": Preloads specific GRUB modules. For LUKS support, you might preload luks and cryptodisk like this:

```bash
grub-install /dev/nvme0n1 --modules="luks cryptodisk"
```
- `--target=`: Specifies the target platform (e.g., x86_64-efi, i386-pc, etc.).
- `--boot-directory=`: Specifies the directory where the boot files are installed.
- `--efi-directory=`: Specifies the EFI system partition (for UEFI systems).

However, even if you preload the `luks` and `cryptodisk` modules during installation, you still need to configure GRUB to use these features in the actual boot configuration files. This involves:

- Enabling LUKS support in `/etc/default/grub`: As mentioned before, you need to set `GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y` in this file.
- Regenerating GRUB configuration: After setting the options, you need to run `update-grub` to regenerate the `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` file with the new settings.

### Example: Full Workflow

*Hereâ€™s how you would perform a full GRUB installation with `LUKS` support:*

Install GRUB with `LUKS` and `cryptodisk` modules preloaded:

```bash
grub-install /dev/nvme0n1 --modules="luks cryptodisk" --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=GRUB
```

Edit `/etc/default/grub` to enable `cryptodisk`:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
```

Add or modify the following lines:

```bash
GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y
GRUB_PRELOAD_MODULES="luks cryptodisk"
```

Regenerate the GRUB configuration:


```bash
update-grub
```

Reboot and Test: Reboot the system to ensure that GRUB prompts for the LUKS passphrase and can unlock the encrypted partition.

In summary, while you can use grub-install with flags like `--modules` to include support for `LUKS` and `cryptodisk`, you still need to configure the GRUB environment through configuration files (e.g., `/etc/default/grub`) and regenerate the GRUB configuration to ensure that the `cryptodisk` features are correctly set up during boot.

### Command summary

Add these lines to `/etc/default/grub`:
```
GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y
GRUB_PRELOAD_MODULES="luks cryptodisk"
```

```bash
grub-install /dev/nvme0n1 --modules="luks cryptodisk" --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=GRUB
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
update-grub
```

# Boot Encrypted LUKS Drive from GRUB CLI

### Step 1: Boot to the GRUB Command Line

Reboot your system.

When the GRUB menu appears, press `c` to enter the GRUB command line (CLI).

### Step 2: Identify the Encrypted Partition

You need to identify the encrypted partition by its GRUB device name (e.g., (hd0,gpt1)). If you're unsure of the correct device, you can list all available devices using:

```bash
ls
```

This will show the available drives and partitions in the format (hdX,gptY). Replace X and Y with the correct numbers for your setup.

### Step 3: Use cryptomount to Decrypt the Partition

To decrypt the LUKS-encrypted partition, use the cryptomount command followed by the device name. For example:

```bash
cryptomount (hd0,gpt1)
```

GRUB will prompt you to enter the passphrase for the LUKS-encrypted partition. Enter the passphrase, and GRUB will unlock the partition.

### Step 4: Verify the Decrypted Partition

Once the partition is decrypted, you can list the available devices again using ls. You should see a new device named something like `crypto0`, which represents the decrypted partition:

```bash
ls
```

You can explore the decrypted partition with commands like:

```bash
ls (crypto0)/
```

### Step 5: Boot the Decrypted Partition

If your system's root partition is on the decrypted partition, you can now boot it. For example, to boot the Linux kernel from the decrypted partition:

Set the root to the decrypted partition:

```
set root=(crypto0)
```

Load the Linux kernel and the initial RAM disk (initrd):

```bash
linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/mapper/cryptroot ro
initrd /initrd.img
```

Replace `/vmlinuz` and `/initrd.img` with the correct paths for your system if necessary. You can find these paths using the ls command inside the decrypted partition.

Boot the system:

```bash
boot
```

If everything is set up correctly, your system should boot from the decrypted partition.

***Note:***
If you need to automate this process, make sure your GRUB configuration (/boot/grub/grub.cfg) includes the appropriate commands to decrypt the partition automatically during boot, as described in earlier steps with `GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y`.

The `cryptomount` command is only available if the luks and cryptodisk modules are loaded, which should be ensured during the GRUB installation or by preloading them in the configuration.
